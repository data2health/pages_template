  - title: "Value and Vision"
    excerpt: "Among the biggest challenges with translational science is understanding what activities and structures are most associated with success, therefore knowing where to invest resources. There have not been sufficient frameworks to define best practices or tools to help organizations identify their gaps and opportunities. We have identified and developed these frameworks and tools (maturity models) that define pathways to achieving best practices. We are also developing tools to overcome specific barriers to success in data use and sharing data for open science."

    excerpt: "We are actively seeking community members to share data use agreements, and help us understand applicable use cases for our data discovery tools. Also, we would appreciate CTSAs being involved in the assessment of new and developing maturity models. Signal your interest at http://cd2h.org/onboard"
