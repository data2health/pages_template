    excerpt: "The path to a mature, high-performing and effective research informatics system varies by topic, is evolving rapidly and is often undefined. Organizations can be strong in some areas but weak in others, and it is difficult to know what areas of focus are most important for investment and improvement to achieve broader success.  CTSA hubs are often unclear of where their specific gaps are, how best to prioritize and address them, and what resources are required to do so.  Maturity models enable hubs to assess, advance, and innovate their open science and research IT."
