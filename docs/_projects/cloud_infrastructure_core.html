  - title: "Value and Vision"
    excerpt: "Computational technologies and tools are vital to clinical and translational research; however Hubs currently develop, deploy, and manage these independently. As a result, these processes are tedious, costly, heterogeneous, and less secure. This core is establishing a common tool and cloud computing architecture to provide CTSA hubs with an affordable, easy to use, and scalable deployment paradigm. Hubs can promote and deploy their own tools as well as adopt others’ products, thereby transcending long-standing “boundaries” and solving common and recurring information needs."
