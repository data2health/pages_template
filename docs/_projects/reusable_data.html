    excerpt: "Computing and analytics have altered the landscape of what it means to use data, thereby straining the legal frameworks that govern it. Research and industry alike are in need of new legal frameworks that facilitate data access and redistribution rights while securing accountability, attribution, and the sustained availability of the merged and underlying data sources. The Reusable Data Project  hopes to do for data sharing what the Uniform Biological Material Transfer Agreement (UBMTA) has done for materials sharing across institutions."
