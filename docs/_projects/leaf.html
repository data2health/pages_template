    excerpt: "Leaf helps query clinical databases of nearly any data model for cohort estimation and data extraction. Leaf seamlessly integrates with clinical databases and existing enterprise authentication systems to unleash the potential of translational biomedical research. Leaf advancement is made possible by engaging several CTSA hubs to pilot the tool at their institution. UW developers have been working closely with resources at CTSA hubs to implement Leaf, file bugs, features and collaborate via GitHub."
