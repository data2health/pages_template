    excerpt: "To be efficient and effective translational agents, hubs need to make their diverse resources and services more easily discovered. Organizations expend substantial effort maintaining local databases of effectively the same content: services, people, trials, publications, grants, etc. The SciTS platform performs large-scale integration from a large variety of source using both structured and unstructured information, and makes these data available to hubs in a variety of easily consumed forms."
