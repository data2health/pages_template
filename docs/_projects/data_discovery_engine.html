    excerpt: "CTSA hubs and partner organizations have a wealth of data and opportunities for collaboration, yet it is challenging to identify existing datasets that can be leveraged to help power investigation. Moreover, there are increasing mandates for data sharing by funding agencies to promote reuse and access. This project creates  a pathway and tooling for hubs to define and expose their data resources in a easy and reusable way so that others can find them via multiple contexts including Google Dataset Search and other search portals."
