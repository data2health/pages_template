    excerpt: "This project enables the tracking and attribution of diverse contributions to support credit for work, better understanding of what skills and activities are needed, and incentivizes participation. Here, we aim to create infrastructure components to identify, aggregate, present and, ultimately, assess the impact of these contributions made in team-based science that vary in type and intensity, but which are vital to moving science forward."
