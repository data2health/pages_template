    excerpt: "Clinical data is among the most valuable artifacts among CTSA hubs.  Appropriately leveraging that data for translational research, while respecting privacy and honoring hub autonomy, will advance CTSA goals and demonstrate our power as a network. The HL7 FHIR standard makes it possible for hubs to develop a next-generation repository that is truly integration-ready, whether directly for federated query or for transformation to any number of common standards."
