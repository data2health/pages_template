    excerpt: "Federated analyses of clinical data across CTSA hubs is one of the strongest potentials of the network. However, the CTSA clinical data landscape is very heterogeneous in its structure, data quality, and data access. Data harmonization and new semantic technologies can support innovative, collaborative phenotyping and analytics at scale. Fundamentally, we aim to develop an open-science ethos and unite CTSA community data sharing with broader global efforts."
